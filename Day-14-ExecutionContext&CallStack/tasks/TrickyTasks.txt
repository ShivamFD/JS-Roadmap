Predict the exact output and call stack order:
console.log("1");
setTimeout(() => console.log("2"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("3"));
console.log("4");
Explain why this prints undefined:
function test() {
console.log(this);
}
test();
Fix the this loss in this example:
const obj = {
name: "Alice",
greet: function() {
setTimeout(function() {
console.log("Hello " + this.name);
}, 100);
}
};
