for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
setTimeout(() => console.log(i), i * 100);
}
Create a function that returns a function which always adds a specific number (factory pattern).
What will be the output?
console.log(a);
var a = 5;
console.log(a);
let b = 10;
console.log(b);

Fix the memory leak in the above task.
Write a function that creates unique IDs using closure.
Explain the difference between var in a block vs let in a block with example.
Create a chain of 3 nested functions each accessing variables from outer scopes.
What will this print?
function test() {
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
var x = 10;
let y = 20;
}
test();
Implement a once function (a function that can be called only once) using closure.
Create a memoization function using closure.
What is the output?
{
let a = 1;
{
console.log(a);
let a = 2;
}
}
Create a function that returns different functions based on a parameter using closure.
Explain why arrow functions inside object methods don't bind this correctly for scope examples.
Implement a curry function using closures.
What will be the output?
var funcs = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
funcs.push(function() { console.log(i); });
}
funcs0; funcs1; funcs2;
Same as above but with var instead of let – explain the difference.
Create a self-invoking function that creates a private scope with private variables.
Demonstrate shadowing across multiple levels.
What is the output?
function outer() {
var a = 10;
function inner() {
console.log(a);
var a = 20;
}
inner();
}
outer();
