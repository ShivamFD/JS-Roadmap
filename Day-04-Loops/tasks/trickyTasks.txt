11. Find and print the maximum number in an array (e.g., [4, 78, 12, 89, 33] → 89).

12. Find and print the minimum number in an array.

13. Count and print how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in a given string (case insensitive).

14. Reverse an array in place without using reverse() (e.g., [1,2,3] → [3,2,1]).

15. Print the first 15 numbers of the Fibonacci series (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...).

16. Calculate factorial of a number using a loop (e.g., 5! = 120).

17. Find the average of all numbers in an array.

18. From 1 to 20, calculate and print sum of even numbers and sum of odd numbers separately.

19. Remove all duplicates from an array and print the unique array (using loops only).

20. Count frequency of each character in a string and print (e.g., "apple" → a:2, p:2, l:1, e:1).

21. Check if an array is sorted in ascending order (return true/false).

22. Convert a string to Title Case (e.g., "hello world javascript" → "Hello World Javascript").

23. Find and print the second largest number in an array.

24. Print all prime numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop.

25. Check if a string or number is palindrome (e.g., "racecar", 121 → true).

26. Print a pyramid pattern using stars:
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****

27. Print an inverted pyramid:
   *****
   ****
   ***
   **
   *

28. Count total number of words in a sentence (e.g., "I love coding" → 3).

29. Find and print the longest word in a sentence.

30. Convert all strings in an array to uppercase using a loop.

31. Rotate an array to the left by k positions (e.g., [1,2,3,4,5] rotate by 2 → [3,4,5,1,2]).

32. Merge two arrays into one without using concat() or spread.

33. Split a string into an array of characters without using split().

34. Find the sum of digits of a number (e.g., 1234 → 1+2+3+4 = 10).

35. Multiply all numbers in an array and return the product.

36. Find the difference between the largest and smallest number in an array.

37. Replace all spaces in a string with hyphens (e.g., "hello world" → "hello-world").

38. Print only unique characters from a string (remove duplicates).

39. Print frequency of each element in an array (e.g., [1,2,2,3,3,3] → 1:1, 2:2, 3:3).

40. Find intersection of two arrays (common elements) using loops only.

41. Find union of two arrays (all unique elements) without using Set.

42. Generate a random 5-digit number using a loop (10000 to 99999).

43. Count uppercase and lowercase letters separately in a string.

44. Find and print all duplicate elements in an array.

45. Flatten a 2D array into 1D (e.g., [[1,2],[3,4],[5]] → [1,2,3,4,5]).

46. Print all possible substrings of a string (e.g., "abc" → a, ab, abc, b, bc, c).

47. Capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence.

48. Reverse the words in a sentence (e.g., "I love JavaScript" → "JavaScript love I").

49. Convert a decimal number to binary using a loop (no toString(2)).

50. Given a 2D matrix (array of arrays), print the sum of each row.
