JavaScript Loop Practice - 10 EASY TASKS
================================================
Solve each task using any loop (for, while, or do...while).
Write clean, readable code with proper comments.
No hints — pure practice!

1. Print all numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) — one number per line.

2. Print all EVEN numbers from 1 to 20 (inclusive).

3. Print all ODD numbers from 1 to 20 (inclusive).

4. Take a string (e.g., "JavaScript") and print each character on a new line.

5. Given an array like [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], print every element using a for loop.

6. Calculate and print the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 (1 + 2 + ... + 50).

7. Take a positive integer (e.g., 4583) and count how many digits it has using a loop.

8. Print the multiplication table of 5 (5 × 1 = 5, 5 × 2 = 10, ..., up to 5 × 10).

9. Reverse a string (e.g., "hello" → "olleh") using a loop (no reverse() method).

10. Print numbers from 10 down to 1 (countdown) using a loop.
