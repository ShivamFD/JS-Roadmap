## 60 Tricky & Useful Tasks for Arrays Part 2 (map, filter, reduce, every, some)

21. Use map to create array of object properties (e.g., ages from users).
22. Use filter to remove falsy values (compact array).
23. Use reduce to create object from array (key-value pairs).
24. Use reduce to flatten nested arrays.
25. Use every to check if array is strictly increasing.
26. Use some to find if array has duplicates.
27. Chain map & filter to transform and select.
28. Use reduce to group by property (e.g., by category).
29. Use reduce to implement map() manually.
30. Use reduce to implement filter() manually.
31. Use reduce for running total (cumulative sum).
32. Use every with callback using index.
33. Use some to check palindrome array.
34. Chain to find average of positives.
35. Use reduce to reverse array.
36. Use map with index to create ranked list.
37. Use filter to get unique values (with indexOf).
38. Use reduce to find min and max in one pass.
39. Use every to validate email array (regex).
40. Use some to check if array has NaN.
41. Use reduce to count words in string array.
42. Chain filter & reduce to sum odds.
43. Use map to format dates in array.
44. Use filter on nested objects (e.g., active users with age >18).
45. Use reduce to merge array of objects.
46. Use every to check all even with bitwise.
47. Use some for existence without includes.
48. Implement find() using reduce.
49. Implement findIndex() using reduce.
50. Use reduce for cartesian product (two arrays).
51. Chain to normalize array (toLowerCase + trim).
52. Use map to async promises (but sync here).
53. Use reduce to build query string from array.
54. Use every for type checking all strings.
55. Use some for partial match in strings.
56. Use reduce to create frequency map.
57. Chain filter, map, reduce for pipeline stats.
58. Use map with array arg (rare use).
59. Use reduceRight for right-to-left aggregation.
60. Use every/some with objects (deep checks).
61. Implement chunk array using reduce.
62. Use map to clone deep (simple).
63. Use filter to remove by index condition.
64. Use reduce to interleave arrays.
65. Chain to find unique evens doubled.
66. Use some for short-circuit search.
67. Use every for validation chain.
68. Use reduce to simulate join().
69. Use map for side effects (log + transform).
70. Use reduce for balancing parentheses check.
71. Implement flat() using reduce.
72. Use filter with index (alternate items).
73. Use reduce to find longest string.
74. Chain for data normalization + aggregation.
75. Use every to check sorted.
76. Use some for error detection.
77. Use map to create pairs [item, index].
78. Use reduce for custom sort simulation.
79. Implement includes using some.
80. Chain map, filter, every for full test.
